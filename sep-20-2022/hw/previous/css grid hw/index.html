        <div class="queen1">Elizabeth II was born in Mayfair, London on the 21st of April 1926 as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York. Her father, Prince Albert, Duke of York, ascended the throne and became king in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother, King Edward VIII. This, in turn, made Elizabeth the heir presumptive, meaning that she had a claim to the throne that could be set aside by the birth of another heir.<br><br>

Elizabethâ€™s education in her early life was overseen by her mother, who appointed a governess, Marion Crawford, to school all of her daughters.
