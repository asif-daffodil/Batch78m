              Messi started playing football as a boy and in 1995 joined the
              youth team of Newell’s Old Boys (a Rosario-based top-division
              football club). Messi’s phenomenal skills garnered the attention
              of prestigious clubs on both sides of the Atlantic. At age 13
              Messi and his family relocated to Barcelona, and he began playing
              for FC Barcelona’s under-14 team. He scored 21 goals in 14 games
              for the junior team, and he quickly graduated through the
              higher-level teams until at age 16 he was given his informal debut
              with FC Barcelona in a friendly match.
